# Data-Wrangling
Data assessment and cleaning steps applied to an online job posting data set

##Project Overview
In this project, we have explored the 3 key steps in Data Wrangling:
1. Gather data
2. Assess data
3. Clean data 

The dataset has 19001 job postings that are assessed to identify the key issues with the dataset. These have then been converted from the assess step into defined problems, and under cleaning have been translated to sophisticated code to fix these problems.
Finally the dataset is tested using assert statements to make sure the operations worked.

This doesn't demonestrate all the possible data issues, but shows how to approach the most common data cleaning steps.
